# Hackaton2022
We participated in a Hackaton that was about smart cities, we developed an intelligent system that is based on cameras which placed all around the city.  
Our main server runs threads of all the streets, every street runs calculations of all the cameras it contains.  
One of the calculations is the level of light that every street lamp will give so it will save up to 25% of the electricity that used to light the street.   
The calculations are made by detection of two parameters: brightnes in the street and the number of the people in the street.  
The server also detect different environmental hazards such as flood and fire by using Computer Vision functions.
